# Take a Break

A simple macOS menu bar app that reminds you to take eye and stretch breaks.

## Features
- **Eye Breaks**: 20-second reminders to look away every 20 minutes.
- **Stretch Breaks**: 5-minute reminders to move around every hour.
- **Fullscreen Support**: Overlays appear over YouTube and other fullscreen apps.
- **Motivational Messages**: Randomly selected sentences for every break.
- **Native Experience**: Built with SwiftUI for a modern macOS feel.

## Credits
This project was inspired by [Stretchly](https://hovancik.net/stretchly/). I've used Stretchly for a long time and wanted to try building my own version of it using native Swift and SwiftUI.
